												<p>The rigorous mathematical foundation for calculus and advanced mathematics</p>
											</header>

											<section>
												<h3>The Completeness of Real Numbers</h3>
												<p>
													Real Analysis provides the rigorous mathematical foundation for calculus and advanced mathematics. 
													My studies in this field include understanding the completeness of real numbers, limits and continuity, 
													differentiation and integration, and the fundamental theorems that underpin modern analysis. 
													These concepts are essential for understanding the theoretical foundations of numerical methods and statistics.
												</p>
												<p>
													The completeness property of real numbers is fundamental to all of analysis, ensuring that 
													sequences and series behave in predictable ways. This property is what makes calculus 
													possible and distinguishes real numbers from rational numbers.
												</p>
											</section>

											<section>
												<h3>Limits and Continuity</h3>
												<p>
													The concept of limits is central to calculus and analysis. I study the rigorous definition 
													of limits, continuity, and uniform continuity, understanding how these concepts form the 
													foundation for differentiation and integration. This includes exploring the relationship 
													between continuity and differentiability, and the various types of discontinuities.
												</p>
											</section>

											<section>
												<h3>Differentiation and Integration</h3>
												<p>
													I study the rigorous foundations of differentiation and integration, including the 
													mean value theorem, the fundamental theorem of calculus, and various integration techniques. 
													This includes understanding when functions are differentiable or integrable, and the 
													conditions under which the fundamental theorem of calculus holds.
												</p>
											</section>

											<section>
												<h3>Sequences and Series</h3>
												<p>
													The study of sequences and series is crucial for understanding convergence and divergence 
													of infinite processes. I work with convergence tests, power series, Taylor series, and 
													Fourier series, understanding how these concepts apply to both theoretical mathematics 
													and practical applications.
												</p>
											</section>

											<section>
												<h3>Metric Spaces and Topology</h3>
												<p>
													I study the more general framework of metric spaces and topological concepts, which 
													generalize many of the ideas from real analysis to more abstract settings. This includes 
													understanding open and closed sets, compactness, connectedness, and how these concepts 
													apply to function spaces and other mathematical structures.
												</p>
											</section>

											<section>
												<h3>Applications to Numerical Methods</h3>
												<p>
													The theoretical foundations from real analysis are essential for understanding why 
													numerical methods work and when they can be trusted. I study how concepts like 
													convergence, continuity, and differentiability apply to numerical algorithms and 
													help predict their behavior and accuracy.
