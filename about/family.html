												<h3>Personal Life & Family</h3>
												<p>
													When I'm not diving deep into data or solving mathematical problems, I enjoy spending time 
													with family and friends. I'm passionate about continuous learning and believe that curiosity 
													is one of the most important traits for both personal growth and professional success. 
													Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I enjoy following the NBA, playing tennis 
													(and now pickleball as I've gotten older), and occasionally attempting rock climbing.
												</p>
												<p>
													Family is incredibly important to me, and I value the support and encouragement they provide 
													in all my endeavors. Whether it's discussing the latest data science trends over dinner or 
													explaining why a particular statistical method is so elegant, I appreciate having people 
													in my life who share my enthusiasm for learning and discovery.
												</p>

												<h3>Hobbies & Interests</h3>
												<p>
													Beyond mathematics and data science, I have a wide range of interests that keep me engaged 
													and balanced. I'm an avid sports fan, particularly of basketball, and enjoy analyzing games 
													from both a statistical and strategic perspective. I also enjoy outdoor activities like 
													hiking and rock climbing, which provide a nice contrast to the more cerebral work I do 
													during the day.
												</p>
											</section>

											<section>
												<h3>Learning & Growth</h3>
												<p>
													I believe that continuous learning is essential for both personal and professional development. 
													I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to expand my knowledge, whether through 
													formal education, online courses, or hands-on projects. I particularly enjoy exploring the 
													intersection of different fields, such as how mathematical concepts apply to sports analytics 
													or how statistical methods can be used to solve real-world problems.
												</p>
											</section>

											<section>
												<h3>Community Involvement</h3>
												<p>
													I believe in giving back to the community and sharing knowledge with others. I enjoy mentoring 
													students who are interested in data science and mathematics, and I'm always happy to discuss 
													career paths, academic challenges, or interesting problems with anyone who's curious about 
													these fields.
