												<h2>Player Statistics & Performance Metrics</h2>
												<p>Advanced metrics and analysis of NBA player performance</p>
											</header>

											<section>
												<h3>Advanced Player Metrics</h3>
												<p>
													I develop and analyze advanced player metrics that go beyond traditional box score statistics. 
													This includes creating composite efficiency ratings, analyzing player impact on team performance, 
													and studying the evolution of player skills over time. My work helps identify undervalued players 
													and predict future performance trends.
												</p>
												<p>
													These metrics consider factors like usage rate, true shooting percentage, player efficiency rating, 
													and advanced plus-minus statistics to provide a more complete picture of a player's contribution 
													to team success.
												</p>
											</section>

											<section>
												<h3>Player Development Analysis</h3>
												<p>
													I study how players develop and improve over time, analyzing skill progression, injury recovery, 
													and the factors that contribute to player growth. This includes understanding how different 
													playing styles, coaching, and team situations affect player development trajectories.
												</p>
											</section>

											<section>
												<h3>Clutch Performance</h3>
												<p>
													Some players perform better under pressure, and I analyze clutch situations to understand 
													which players consistently step up in important moments. This includes studying performance 
													in close games, playoff situations, and high-pressure scenarios to identify players who 
													thrive when it matters most.
												</p>
											</section>

											<section>
												<h3>Injury Impact Analysis</h3>
												<p>
													Injuries significantly affect player performance and career trajectories. I analyze how 
													different types of injuries impact player statistics, recovery patterns, and long-term 
													performance to help understand the relationship between health and on-court success.
												</p>
											</section>

											<section>
												<h3>Positional Analysis</h3>
												<p>
													The NBA has evolved significantly in terms of positional roles and responsibilities. 
													I analyze how different positions contribute to team success, how the traditional 
													positional structure is changing, and what skills are most valuable for each position 
													in the modern NBA.
												</p>
											</section>

											<section>
												<h3>Player Comparison & Evaluation</h3>
												<p>
													I develop frameworks for comparing players across different eras, positions, and playing 
													styles. This includes adjusting for pace, era, and team context to make fair comparisons 
													between players and understand how the game has evolved over time.
