												<h2>Game Predictions & Salary Analysis</h2>
												<p>Using machine learning to predict NBA outcomes and player values</p>
											</header>

												<h3>NBA Player Salary Predictions</h3>
												<p>
													One of my featured projects involves using machine learning to predict NBA player salaries based on 
													performance metrics. By analyzing historical data on player statistics, team success, and market 
													conditions, I've developed models that can estimate player value and predict salary trends. 
													This work combines sports analytics with economic modeling to understand the business side of basketball.
												</p>
												<p>
													The model considers factors like traditional statistics, advanced metrics, team performance, 
													and market conditions to estimate player value. This project demonstrates the intersection 
													of sports analytics and business intelligence.

												<h3>Game Outcome Prediction</h3>
												<p>
													I develop predictive models to forecast game outcomes based on team statistics, player matchups, 
													and historical performance patterns. These models consider factors like home court advantage, 
													rest days, injury reports, and recent team form to predict game results with higher accuracy 
													than traditional methods.
												</p>

												<h3>Player Performance Forecasting</h3>
												<p>
													Using machine learning algorithms, I predict how players will perform in upcoming games based on 
													historical data, matchups, and situational factors. This includes predicting individual statistics, 
													identifying breakout candidates, and understanding which players are likely to exceed or fall short 
													of expectations.
												</p>
											</section>

											<section>
												<h3>Injury Risk Assessment</h3>
												<p>
													I analyze player injury patterns and workload to predict injury risk and optimize player rest 
													strategies. This includes studying the relationship between minutes played, travel schedules, 
													and injury frequency to help teams make informed decisions about player management.
												</p>
											</section>

											<section>
												<h3>Draft Prospect Evaluation</h3>
												<p>
													I develop models to evaluate NBA draft prospects by analyzing college statistics, physical 
													measurements, and other factors that correlate with NBA success. This helps identify undervalued 
													prospects and understand which skills translate best from college to the professional level.
												</p>
											</section>

											<section>
												<h3>Trade Value Analysis</h3>
												<p>
													I create frameworks for evaluating player trade value by considering performance metrics, 
													contract status, age, and team needs. This helps understand the relative value of different 
													players and assess the fairness of proposed trades from a data-driven perspective.
